# **Project Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Project Overview**

You are building an Expo React Native application for **Android, iOS, and web** that enables **BLET Union members** to request scheduling for **Personal Leave Days (PLDs)** and **Single Vacation Days (SVDs)**. Future iterations will include managing **week-long vacation bids** and expanding to support website functionality.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Framework**: Expo SDK 52, React Native
- **Styling**: NativeWind
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui-inspired react-native-reusables
- **Backend**: Self-hosted Supabase (Authentication, RBAC, File Storage)
- **Deployment**: Coolify

---

## **Core Functionalities**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

User roles and permissions are strictly defined and stored in the **Supabase members table** (not overriding built-in auth roles). A Supabase hook will automatically assign **new members as users**.

| Role                  | Permissions                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Admin** | Full access to all functions, including administrative dashboard controls.                         |
| **Union Admin**       | Manages union-level functions, including adding/removing divisions and overseeing division admins. |
| **Division Admin**    | Administers a specific division, including managing schedules, user roles, and approvals.          |
| **Company Admin**     | Processes and marks leave requests as completed. Only accesses company dashboard, not user areas.  |
| **User**              | Can edit their profile, submit requests for PLDs, SVDs, and week-long vacation scheduling.         |

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Roles are stored in the **Supabase members table**.
> - A Supabase auth hook will automatically assign **new members** as users.
> - Roles do not override **Supabaseâ€™s built-in auth roles**.

### **2. Divisions**

The **CN/WC GCA of the BLET** includes the following divisions:

- **163** - Proctor, MN
- **173** - Fond Du Lac, WI
- **174** - Stevens Point, WI
- **175** - Neenah, WI
- **184** - Schiller Park, IL
- **185** - Gladstone, MI
- **188** - Superior, WI
- **209** - Green Bay, WI
- **520** - Joliet, IL

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Each user is assigned to a **single division**.
> - Each division has **its own set of officers and calendars**.

### **3. Division Officers**

Each division may assign the following **officer positions**, managed by the **Division Admin**:

- **Required Positions:** President, Vice-President, Secretary/Treasurer, Alternate Secretary/Treasurer, Legislative Representative, Alternate Legislative Representative, Local Chairman, First Vice-Local Chairman, Second Vice-Local Chairman, Guide, Chaplain, Delegate to the National Division, First Alternate Delegate to the National Division, Second Alternate Delegate to the National Division, First Trustee, Second Trustee, Third Trustee, First Alternate Trustee, Second Alternate Trustee, Third Alternate Trustee.
- **Optional Positions:** Third Vice-Local Chairman, Fourth Vice-Local Chairman, Fifth Vice-Local Chairman.

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Officer roles will be stored in the **members table**.
> - Assignments are managed in the **Division Admin dashboard**.

### **4. Calendars**

## **PLD/SDV Calendar**

### **1. Objectives**

- Provide a real-time, color-coded calendar for PLD/SDV availability.
- Enable union members to request PLD/SDV with a first-come, first-served system.
- Allow Division Admins to manage daily/weekly allotments dynamically.
- Support waitlists for full dates based on seniority.
- Ensure RBAC enforcement (Admins, Local Chairmen, and Members).

### **2. User Roles & Permissions**

| **Role**              | **Permissions**                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Union Member**      | View PLD/SDV calendar, submit requests, cancel pending requests, view approvals/denials, join waitlists. |
| **Local Chairman**    | Approve/deny PLD/SDV requests, manage waitlists, escalate to Division Admins.                            |
| **Division Admin**    | Manage PLD/SDV allotments, override approvals/denials, adjust quotas dynamically.                        |
| **Application Admin** | Manage users, divisions, and system-wide settings.                                                       |

### **3. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1 PLD/SDV Request Flow**

1. User selects a **date** on the calendar.
2. System displays **available PLD/SDV slots** for that date.
3. If slots are available:
   - User submits a request.
   - Application auto-approves unless there are conflicts/multiple requests at the same time, then the Local Chairman reviews and approves/denies it.
   - If approved, the request is confirmed, and the user is notified.
4. If slots are full:
   - User may **join a waitlist** (ranked by request time and seniority).
   - If a spot opens, the top-ranked user is automatically assigned the slot.
5. Requests must be made **at least 48 hours in advance**.
6. Requests are **locked once approved**, unless changed by the Local Chairman.

#### **3.2 PLD/SDV Calendar**

- **Color-coded availability**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** = Available slots
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** = Limited slots
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** = Full (waitlist available)
- Users can request either **PLD or SDV** (allotment is shared between the two day types, but all days must be tracked by type).
- Division Admins can **adjust allotments dynamically** (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly).

#### **3.3 Seniority-Based PLD Allocation**

- PLD entitlement is based on **Company Hire Date** (stored in `members` table).
- System calculates maximum PLDs per year using the following rules:

| **Years of Service** | **Max PLDs** |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| 1 to <3 years        | 5            |
| 3 to <6 years        | 8            |
| 6 to <10 years       | 11           |
| 10+ years            | 13           |

- Division Admins can **manually override PLD entitlements** in special cases.

#### **3.4 Notifications System**

- **Email & in-app alerts** for:
  - Request approval/denial
  - Waitlist promotion
  - Admin changes to allotments

### **4. Data Model (Supabase)**

#### **4.1 Tables**

##### **Divisions**

- `id` (Integer, PK)
- `name` (String)

##### **PLD_SDV_Requests**

- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `member_id` (UUID, FK -> Members)
- `division_id` (Integer, FK -> Divisions)
- `request_date` (Date)
- `type` (Enum: "PLD", "SDV")
- `status` (Enum: "pending", "approved", "denied", "waitlisted")
- `requested_at` (Timestamp)

##### **PLD_SDV_Allotments**

- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `division_id` (Integer, FK -> Divisions)
- `date` (Date)
- `max_allotment` (Integer)
- `current_requests` (Integer)

### **5. Tech Stack & Implementation**

- **Framework**: Expo (React Native)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router
- **UI Styling**: NativeWind
- **State Management**: Zustand (or React Context)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, RBAC)
- **Deployment**: Coolify

### **6. Future Enhancements**

- **Automated PLD/SVD payouts** based on denied requests.
- **Bulk approvals** for Local Chairmen.
- **Integration with payroll** for payment tracking of days requested to be paid in lieu.

#### **Full-Week Vacation Calendar**

- Users **submit vacation preferences** through the app.
- **Auto-scheduling** fills available slots until **Division Admin approval**.
- Vacation follows **seniority-based assignment** rules.
- Vacation periods can **span across years** (e.g., December 30 - January 5).

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Admins can override **automatic scheduling**.
> - Division Admins manage **final vacation approvals**.

### **5. My Time**

Each user has a **"My Time" dashboard** displaying:

- **PLD/SVD Balance**: Total, Available, Requested, Waitlisted, Approved, Paid in Lieu.
- **Approved Requests List**: Submission timestamp, Requested Date, Type, Approval timestamp.
- **Pending Requests List**: Submission timestamp, Requested Date, Type.
- **Waitlisted Requests**: Position, Date, Type.

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Data is fetched from **Supabase tables** for live tracking.

### **6. News & Notifications**

Admins can post **news updates & notifications**:

- **Union Admins** can send to **all members**.
- **Division Admins** can send to their **division members**.
- **Admins can communicate privately**.
- Some messages require **acknowledgment** before users can continue.

> **Implementation Notes:**
>
> - Messages have **start/end display dates**.

### **7. Future Expansion**

Planned **website integration**:

- Forms
- Tools
- Links
- Additional union resources
